# Python Development Technical Assessment Critical Mass

This python project contains the solution to the Python Development Technical Assessment for Critical Mass.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Python 3.7 or later.
* You have a basic understanding of Python and command-line applications.

## Installation

To install the necessary libraries, you'll need to use Pipenv, a packaging tool for Python that simplifies dependency management. Follow these steps:

### Installing Pipenv

If you haven't already installed Pipenv, you can do so by running:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

### Installing the dependencies

```bash
pipenv install
```

## Usage

### Usage 1 to 3 tasks and 5

```bash
pipenv run python tasks_1_to_3_5.py
```

### Usage 4 task

For the task 4, you need to run the microservice. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
pipenv run python task_4_microservice/app.py  
```

For the tests of the microservice, you can run the following command:

```bash
pipenv run python task_4_microservice/test_app.py
```
